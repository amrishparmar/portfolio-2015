      <h1>About <strong>CS50 CryptoPlus</strong></h1>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>This website is my final project for CS50x.</strong></p>
      <p>At the start of 2014 I enrolled onto a course called <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022">CS50x An Introduction to Computer Science</a> which was offered through <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>. I was looking for a really thorough introduction to the discipline which couldn't be had through traditional coding courses and this course really fit the bill. It will do me a world of good in my preparations to undertake an undergraduate degree in computer science this coming September.</p>
      <p>The idea for this site came from Problem Set 2 in Week 2 of the course. We were asked to write two programs, one of which was to encrypt text into ciphertext using the Caesar Shift method and the other was to encrypt text into ciphertext using the Vig√®nere method. Relative to the stage in the course, they both presented a satisfying challenge which I wanted to explore further. Cryptography was a topic that for a long time I have found interesting, as it combines pure mathematics with modern-day computer science problems, such as the need for secure transmission of data over a network, so I decided that I would create something related to this field.</p>
      <p>I primarily developed this site using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript as they are powerful modern web technologies which offer the flexibility to create a wide variety of applications.</p>
      <p><strong>I hope you enjoy using CS50 CryptoPlus!</strong></p>
