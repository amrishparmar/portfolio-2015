  <h1>Hobbies</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>As a musician, one of my biggest passions is playing and creating new music. I play a variety of different instruments, but primarily focus on playing the electric guitar and bass guitar. Every now and again I like to have fun creating recordings of some of my playing. Below is a small selection of tracks that I have created over the years.</p>

        <h2>Funky Time</h2>
        <iframe class="sc-iframes" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/118295648&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>
        <p>This is short funk-inspired track called Funky Time. I used drum machine to produce the percussion sounds and played bass guitar in a slap bass style to complete the rhythm section. I then layered electric guitar chords on top of this to reinforce the harmonies and then finally completed it by adding an improvised melody.</p>

        <p>This piece was actually initally recorded using the iPad version of GarageBand using the iRig tool before finishing on the Mac. It is a classic rock-styled track featuring overdriven guitars and repeated riffs and bass lines. On top of this is an improvised electric guitar pentatonic melody.</p>
        <p><strong>Equipment used:</strong> PRS SE Custom 24, Fender Standard Jazz Bass, GarageBand, iRig</p>

        <p>This track was created purely using loops in the GarageBand DAW. Apple had recently introduced a significant update to the software and I wanted to play around with it and in the process created an electronic music piece.</p>
